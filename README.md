# WorldOS Landing Page

This repository contains a simple landing page for **WorldOS** — the Hybrid AI‑Simulation–Enterprise Engine. The page showcases the core components envisioned for WorldOS and is intended as a lightweight starting point for further development.

## Features

* **Responsive hero section** highlighting the WorldOS brand and tagline.
* **Grid of feature cards** introducing the six major modules:
  - **AI Router Hub**
  - **WarRoom Collaboration**
  - **Simulation Layer**
  - **Outreach Engine**
  - **Knowledge Vault**
  - **Operator Mode**
* **Modern design** with custom CSS, dark theme, and elegant hover effects.
* **Dynamic footer** that automatically displays the current year.

## Development

This site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to avoid the need for package managers or build tools. It’s a great starting point for integrating into a larger framework or back‑end. To extend the project:

1. Replace the static content with dynamic data from your back‑end or APIs.
2. Integrate authentication, secure storage (the knowledge vault), and multi‑model AI routing according to your architecture.
3. Host the site on Vercel by connecting this repository and deploying.

## Deployment

Vercel supports static site deployments out of the box. You can deploy this site by importing the repository into your Vercel account. The `index.html` file will be served as the entry point.
